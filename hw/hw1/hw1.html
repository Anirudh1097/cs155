<hr><h3>Problem 1:  Control hijacking</h3>

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
In x86 the stack grows downwards. Explain how a stack-based overflow attack would work if the stack grew upwards instead.</li>

<li class="part">
How would you implement StackGuard in an architecture where the stack grows upwards? What would be different from StackGuard on the x86?</li>

<li class="part">
How would you implement LibSafe in an architecture where the stack grows upwards? What would be different from LibSafe on the x86?</li>

</ol>

<hr><h3>Problem 2:  Memory management</h3>

<p>
The iOS &nbsp;  <strong>_MALLOC(size_t size, int type, int flags)</strong> function
allocates <strong>size</strong> bytes on the heap.   Internally blocks are
represented as a length field followed by a data field:
</p><pre>    struct _mhead {
      size_t  mlen;
      char    dat[0];  }
</pre>
The <strong>mlen</strong> field is used by the <strong>free()</strong>
function to determine how much space needs to be freed.
In iOS 4.x the <strong>_MALLOC</strong> function was implemented as follows:
<pre>1   void * _MALLOC(size_t size, int type, int flags)  {
2     struct _mhead  *hdr;
3     size_t memsize = sizeof (*hdr) + size;
4     hdr = (void *)kalloc(memsize);  // allocate memory
5     hdr-&gt;mlen = memsize;
6     return  (hdr-&gt;dat);
7   }
</pre>
In iOS 5.x the following two lines were added after line 3:
<pre>    int o = memsize &lt; size ? 1 : 0;
    if (o)  return (NULL);
</pre>

<ol class="parts">

<li class="part">Why were these lines added in iOS5.x?   Briefly describe an attack
that may be possible without these lines.</li>

<li class="part"> In iOS the kernel heap is divided into zones.  When
  the zone allocator is called it allocates a new zone in a random
  location in kernel space.  What security purpose does randomization
  serve in this context?</li>

</ol>

<hr><h3>Problem 3:   Sandboxing  </h3>

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
Explain in what settings would you use VM-based sanboxing rather than
system call interposition.</li>

<li class="part">
Explain in what settings would you use system call interposition
rather than VM-based sanboxing.</li>

<li class="part">
In class we discussed a covert channel between two VMs based on CPU
utilization and a synchronized clock between the VMs.  One might try
to block this covert channel by preventing the VMs from synchronizing
their clocks, e.g. by presenting each VM with a different time of day.
You may assume the clocks run at normal speed, but are shifted by a
random amount for each VM.  Explain how an attacker can defeat this
defense.</li>

<li class="part">
Suggest another method by which the covert channel based on CPU utilization can be blocked.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<hr><h3>Problem 4: TOCTOU</h3>

<p>Consider the following code snippet:</p>
<pre>  if (!stat("./file.dat", buf)) return;   // Abort if file exists.
  sleep(10);                              // Sleep for 10 seconds.
  fp = fopen("./file.dat", "w" );
  fprintf(fp, "Hello world" );
  close(fp);
</pre>

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
Suppose this code is running as a setuid root program.
Give an example of how this code can lead to unexpected behavior
that could cause a security problem.   (try using symbolic links.)
</li>

<li class="part">
Suppose the sleep(10) is removed from the
code above.   Could the problem you identified in part (a) still occur?
Please explain.
</li>

<li class="part">
How would you fix the code to prevent the problem from part (a)?
</li>
</ol>

<hr><h3>Problem 5: Soundness and completeness for static code analysis </h3>

In lecture 3, we discussed these two definitions briefly:

<p>
<i>Soundness:</i> If the program contains an error, the analysis will report a warning.

</p><p>
<i>Completeness:</i> If the analysis reports an error, the program will contain an error.

</p><ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
A <i>false alarm</i> occurs when a tool reports an error, but the program the tool is analyzing does not contain an error.
Can a tool that reports a false alarm be sound? Complete?
</li>

<li class="part">
Suppose a company sets up an Android app marketplace for its employees. The company is going to use an analysis
tool to check apps for security vulnerabilities before it promotes them to its employees. Which tool property is critical to the company
for this purpose: soundness or completeness?
</li>

<li class="part">
Theoretically, suppose a tool is both sound and complete. When the tool is used to analyze the following code that
<i>may</i> contain a vulnerability, what property of the loop determines whether the tool will report an error?
<pre>      int main()
      { 
        int x = 0;  
        while ( x &lt; 10 ) { /* loop while x is less than 10 */
             ...  /* do some stuff that might change the value of x  */
        }
        ... /* do something insecure */;
      }
</pre>
</li></ol>

<hr><h3>Problem 6: Changing your Unix password </h3>

The Unix passwd program allows users to change their passwords. 
This problem asks you about the access permissions required to do this.
Here, for reference, is a summary of the read-write-execute permissions 
associated with any Unix file (from Wikipedia).

<ol class="parts">
<li class="part">
The password file is owned by the system (root) and readable by any user. Write appropriate permissions in the symbolic notation illustrated above. Any answer is acceptable for group permissions.
</li>

<li class="part">
The passwd program is owned by the system (root). What Unix feature allows an ordinary user to run passwd and change their password? Explain.
</li>

<li class="part">
When a normal user, say "bob", runs passwd, passwd starts with: 
<pre>      Real-UID = bob 
      Effective-UID = bob 
      Saved-UID = root 
</pre>
The program makes a system call "seteuid( 0 )". What will be the Real-UID, Effective-UID, Saved-UID after this call?
</li>

<li class="part">
Suppose the program called "seteuid( alice )" instead, <i>before</i> calling "seteuid( 0 )". What would be the Real-UID, Effective-UID, Saved-UID after this call?
</li>

<li class="part">
Suppose the program called "seteuid( alice )" <i>after</i> calling "seteuid( 0 )". What would be the Real-UID, Effective-UID, Saved-UID after this call?
</li>

<li class="part">
Of course, passwd does not call "seteuid( alice )". 
Explain why passwd can write /etc/passwd and change password for user "bob" after the call seteuid( 0 ).
</li>

<li class="part">
Suppose passwd reads some other user input and does some other action after changing the password file. For example,
we might want a custom version of passwd that writes into a log file owned by bob, when bob changes his password.
What system call would you recommend after writing the password file and before doing other actions? 
What will be the  Real-UID, Effective-UID, Saved-UID after the system call you recommend?
