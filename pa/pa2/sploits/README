Notes: 

- Attack B works with the original version of transfer.php which includes framebusting defense code.
- Attack E works also if the user inputs his username/password incorrectly any number of times. The 
  attack is robust enough to stick around until the user enters the correct username/password pair. 
  Only then will the attack make the GET request to /credentials.php to steal the credentials.
